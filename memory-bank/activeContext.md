# Active Context - SwiftWhisper Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
**Phase:** PLAN Mode - Architectural Planning in Progress
**Task:** Integrate SwiftWhisper for real-time speech recognition
**Status:** Comprehensive planning and architecture design in progress

## ðŸ“‹ Planning Results

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **MVP Pattern** with clear separation of concerns
- **Singleton Pattern** for WhisperKitManager
- **Delegate Pattern** for communication (no Combine)
- **Async/Await** for asynchronous operations
- **7 Core Components** identified and designed

### Implementation Strategy
- **6 Phases** planned with clear dependencies
- **Phase 1** ready to begin: Project Setup & Dependencies
- **Creative Phases** identified and designed
- **Testing Strategy** comprehensive and structured

### Key Components Designed
1. **WhisperKitManager** - Core coordination singleton
2. **ModelDownloadManager** - Model caching and download with progress
3. **AudioRecordingManager** - Real-time audio capture and 16kHz PCM conversion
4. **TranscriptionViewController** - UI implementation with MVP pattern
5. **RecognitionPresenter** - Business logic and coordination
6. **RetryManager** - Error handling with exponential backoff
7. **ErrorHandler** - User-friendly error messages
8. **ProgressView** - Model download and warmup progress
9. **StartStopButton** - Recording control with state management

## ðŸš€ Next Action
**Complete Architectural Planning Phase**
- Finalize component architecture design
- Complete technical specification
- Plan implementation phases with dependencies
- Prepare for CREATIVE mode transition
